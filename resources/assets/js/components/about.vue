                    <h2>About Southeast PHP</h2>
                    <p>Southeast PHP is a multi-track PHP conference providing developers at any stage in their careers a chance to learn something new and contribute to the community.</p>
                    <p>As organizers of Nashville PHP, we realized there was a lack of regional PHP Conferences in the Southeast United States. We aim to start our conference in 2018, and plan to move it to other cities within the southeast to better serve developers in various areas.</p>
                    <p>Some cities we aim to take Southeast PHP to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raleigh, NC</li>
                        <li>Greenville, SC</li>
                        <li>Charleston, SC</li>
                        <li>Birmingham, AL</li>
                        <li>Little Rock, AK</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And as many more as we can make happen!</p>

                    <h3>When and Where</h3>
                    <p>Southeast PHP will take place in the last week of August, 2018. It is a great time to visit Nashville and really take in the beauty of the city.</p>
                    <p>Our venue is the <a href="https://hotelpreston.com">Hotel Preston</a>, that sits in between the airport (BNA) and downtown Nashville. We picked this location for ease of access and its hip feel.</p>
                    <p>To see more of what you can do while in Nashville, you can visit the <a href="/#/nashville">Nashville</a> page for things to check out!</p>
